1. At line 9, it will return "values added: 20"
2. At line 13, it will return "final result: 20"
3. Line 9 will print the same thing as before, "values added: 20"
4. Line 13 will get a ReferenceError because the print statement is outside of the "if" block where result is declared
5. The code returns a TypeError since a const variable can't be changed and the change was attempted at line 7 when we declared result = 0
6. The code will not reach this point because the error was found on line 7.
